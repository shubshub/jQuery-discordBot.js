The rules of Battle Dice are Simple
Both players roll up to 6 10 Sided Die
However a number of different battle styles may be used which may give an advantage
They will be balanced so that none are overpowered


Pick a Battle Style for the Dice Roll

Battle Style 1: One of the Rolled Die is Guarenteed to be a 10
Battle Style 2: 3 of the Die Rolled will be Rolled with the Same Value
Battle Style 3: Roll 1 60 Sided Die
Battle Style 4: Both Players Exchange their Strongest Rolled Number
Battle Style 5: The dice rolled can not be lower than 5 in value
(If the Opponent uses Battle Style 3 then Players Exchange all their Die with each other)

/*
Potential Good Combo
Style 4 against Style 1, Player with Style 4 is guarenteed atleast 1 10, While Style 1 may not be left with a 10

Style 2 against Style 4, Player with Style 4 may be left with a relatively low number

Style 3 against Style 1, A Guarenteed 10 might not work well against a Roll out of 60

Style 1 Against Style 2, If Style 2 rolls low for one of the dice then they may have 3 Really low numbers against a Gaurenteed 10

Style 4 against Style 3, Style 3 Might be left with low Dice Rolls compared to what they could of had

Style 5 against Style 2, The 3 rolled dice can be any value between 1 and 10 While Style 5 can't roll lower than a 5

Style 5 against Style 5, Evenly Matched
